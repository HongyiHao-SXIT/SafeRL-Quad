# Reinforcement Learning Methods for Quadruped Robot Control

This guide introduces value iteration, policy gradient, DQN, and PPO methods, with recommended papers and special focus on their applications in quadruped robot control.

## 1. Value Iteration (VI)

**Core Concept**:  
A classical DP-based RL method that finds optimal policy by iteratively updating state value functions.

**Quadruped Applications**:
- Suitable for simple control with discrete state/action spaces
- Can be used for basic gait planning or navigation

**Characteristics**:
- Requires complete environment model (transition probabilities)
- Guaranteed convergence to optimal policy
- Not suitable for high-dim continuous spaces

**Key Papers**:
- Bellman, R. (1957). "Dynamic Programming". Princeton University Press.
- Howard, R. A. (1960). "Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes".

**Pseudocode**:
```
Initialize V(s) for all s
Repeat until convergence:
    For each state s:
        Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ * Σ P(s'|s,a)V(s')
        V(s) = max_a Q(s,a)
Return optimal policy π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)
```

## 2. Policy Gradient (PG)

**Core Concept**:  
Directly optimizes parameterized policy via gradient ascent to maximize expected return.

**Quadruped Applications**:
- Suitable for continuous action spaces (e.g., joint torque control)
- Effective for learning complex gaits and terrain adaptation

**Characteristics**:
- Direct policy optimization avoids value function bias
- Handles continuous actions naturally
- High variance, requires many samples

**Key Papers**:
- Williams, R. J. (1992). "Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning"
- Sutton, et al. (2000). "Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation"

**Pseudocode**:
```
Initialize policy parameters θ
Repeat:
    Collect trajectories {s_t,a_t,r_t} using π_θ
    Compute returns R_t for each timestep
    Compute gradient: ∇J(θ) ≈ Σ ∇logπ_θ(a_t|s_t) * R_t
    Update: θ ← θ + α∇J(θ)
```

## 3. Deep Q-Network (DQN)

**Core Concept**:  
Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to approximate Q-function.

**Quadruped Applications**:
- Suitable for high-dim state spaces with discrete actions
- Useful for high-level decision making (e.g., gait selection)

**Characteristics**:
- Experience replay reduces sample correlation
- Target network stabilizes training
- Limited to discrete actions

**Key Papers**:
- Mnih, et al. (2015). "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning". Nature.
- Hasselt, et al. (2015). "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning"

**Key Techniques**:
1. Experience Replay
2. Target Network
3. Gradient Clipping

## 4. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**Core Concept**:  
A policy gradient method that ensures stable training by limiting policy update steps.

**Quadruped Applications**:
- State-of-the-art for quadruped control
- Used in Boston Dynamics Spot and MIT Cheetah
- Effective for complex terrain adaptation and dynamic balancing

**Characteristics**:
- Relatively sample efficient
- Training stability
- Supports continuous actions

**Key Papers**:
- Schulman, et al. (2017). "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms"
- Peng, et al. (2020). "Learning Agile Robotic Locomotion Skills by Imitating Animals"

**Key Techniques**:
1. Importance sampling ratio clipping
2. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
3. Joint policy-value optimization
